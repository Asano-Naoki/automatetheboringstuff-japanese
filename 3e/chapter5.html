<p class="introtni">Now that you know enough to write basic programs, you may start finding not-so- simple bugs in them. This chapter covers some tools and techniques for finding the root cause of bugs in your program to help you fix them more quickly and with less effort. To paraphrase an old joke among programmers, writing code accounts for 90 percent of programming. Debugging code accounts for the other 90 percent.</p>
<p class="tx">Your computer will do only what you tell it to do; it won’t read your mind and do what you <i class="calibre5">intended</i> it to do. Even professional programmers create bugs all the time, so don’t feel discouraged if your program has a problem.</p>
<p class="tx">Fortunately, a few tools and techniques can identify exactly what your code is doing and where it’s going wrong. You’ll use the <i class="calibre5">debugger</i>, a feature of Mu that executes a program one instruction at a time, giving you a chance to inspect the values in variables while your code runs, and track <span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-977" aria-label="96"></span>how the values change over the course of your program. This process is much slower than running the program at full speed, but it allows you to see the actual values in a program while it runs, rather than having to deduce what the values might be from the source code.</p>
<p class="tx">You’ll also make your programs raise custom exceptions to indicate errors, and you’ll learn about logging and assertions, two features that can help you detect bugs early. In general, the earlier you catch bugs, the easier they will be to fix.</p>
<section type="division" aria-labelledby="sec1">
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-1510"><span id="calibre_link-94"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Raising Exceptions</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Python raises an exception whenever it tries to execute invalid code. In <span>Chapter 4</span>, you handled Python’s exceptions with <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">try</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except</span> statements so that your program could recover from exceptions you anticipated. But you can also raise your own exceptions in your code. Raising an exception is a way of saying, “Stop running this code, and move the program execution to the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except</span> statement.”</p>
<p class="tx">We raise exceptions with a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">raise</span> statement, which consists of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="bl">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">raise</span> keyword</li>
<li class="bl">A call to the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Exception()</span> function</li>
<li class="bl">A string with a helpful error message passed to the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Exception()</span> function</li>
</ul>
<p class="tx">For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">raise Exception('This is the error message.')</b>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#191&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    raise Exception('This is the error message.')
Exception: This is the error message.
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">If no <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">try</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except</span> statements cover the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">raise</span> statement that raised the exception, the program simply crashes and displays the exception’s error message.</p>
<p class="tx">Often, it’s the code that calls the function containing a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">raise</span> statement, rather than the function itself, that knows how to handle an exception. That means you’ll commonly see a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">raise</span> statement inside a function, and the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">try</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except</span> statements in the code calling the function. For example, open a new file editor tab, enter the following code, and save the program as <i class="calibre5">boxPrint.py</i>:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">def box_print(symbol, width, height):
    if len(symbol) != 1:
      <span class="code_codeannotation" aria-label="annotation1">❶</span> raise Exception('Symbol must be a single character string.')
    if width &lt;= 2:
      <span class="code_codeannotation" aria-label="annotation2">❷</span> raise Exception('Width must be greater than 2.')
    if height &lt;= 2:
      <span class="code_codeannotation" aria-label="annotation3">❸</span> raise Exception('Height must be greater than 2.')

<span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-932" aria-label="97"></span>    print(symbol * width)
    for i in range(height - 2):
        print(symbol + (' ' * (width - 2)) + symbol)
    print(symbol * width)

try:
    box_print('*', 4, 4)
    box_print('O', 20, 5)
    box_print('x', 1, 3)
    box_print('ZZ', 3, 3)
<span class="codeannotated_codeannotation" aria-label="annotation4">❹</span> except Exception as err:
  <span class="code_codeannotation" aria-label="annotation5">❺</span> print('An exception happened: ' + str(err))
try:
    box_print('ZZ', 3, 3)
except Exception as err:
    print('An exception happened: ' + str(err))
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">Here, we’ve defined a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">box_print()</span> function that takes a character, a width, and a height, and uses the character to make a little picture of a box with that width and height. This box shape is printed to the screen.</p>
<p class="tx">Say we want the function to accept a single character only, and we expect the width and height to be greater than 2. We add <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">if</span> statements to raise exceptions if these requirements aren’t satisfied. Later, when we call <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">box _print()</span> with various arguments, our <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">try-except</span> will handle invalid arguments.</p>
<p class="tx">This program uses the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except Exception as err</span> form of the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except</span> statement <span class="codeannotation" aria-label="annotation4">❹</span>. If an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Exception</span> object is returned from <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">box_print()</span> <span class="codeannotation" aria-label="annotation1">❶</span> <span class="codeannotation" aria-label="annotation2">❷</span> <span class="codeannotation" aria-label="annotation3">❸</span>, this <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except</span> statement will store it in a variable named <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">err</span>. We can then convert the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Exception</span> object to a string by passing it to <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">str()</span> to produce a user-friendly error message <span class="codeannotation" aria-label="annotation5">❺</span>. When you run this <i class="calibre5">boxPrint.py</i>, the output will look like this:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">****
*  *
*  *
****
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
O                  O
O                  O
O                  O
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
An exception happened: Width must be greater than 2.
An exception happened: Symbol must be a single character string.
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">Using the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">try</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except</span> statements, you can handle errors gracefully, rather than letting the entire program crash.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-1511"><span id="calibre_link-95"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Assertions</span></h3>
<p class="tni">An <i class="calibre5">assertion</i> is a sanity check to make sure your code isn’t doing something obviously wrong. We perform these sanity checks with <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> statements. If <span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-1150" aria-label="98"></span>the sanity check fails, the code raises an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">AssertionError</span> exception. An <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> statement consists of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="bl">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> keyword</li>
<li class="bl">A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">True</span> or <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">False</span>)</li>
<li class="bl">A comma</li>
<li class="bl">A string to display when the condition is <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">False</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="tx">In plain English, an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> statement says, “I assert that the condition holds true, and if not, there is a bug somewhere, so immediately stop the program.” For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">ages = [26, 57, 92, 54, 22, 15, 17, 80, 47, 73]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">ages.sort()</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">ages</b>
[15, 17, 22, 26, 47, 54, 57, 73, 80, 92]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">assert ages[0] &lt;= ages[-1]</b>  # Assert that the first age is &lt;= the last age.
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> statement here asserts that the first item in <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">ages</span> should be less than or equal to the last one. This is a sanity check; if the code in <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sort()</span> is bug-free and did its job, then the assertion would be true. Because the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">ages[0] &lt;=</span> <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">ages[-1]</span> expression evaluates to <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">True</span>, the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> statement does nothing.</p>
<p class="tx">However, let’s pretend we had a bug in our code. Say we accidentally called the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">reverse()</span> list method instead of the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sort()</span> list method. When we enter the following in the interactive shell, the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> statement raises an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">AssertionError</span>:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">ages = [26, 57, 92, 54, 22, 15, 17, 80, 47, 73]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">ages.reverse()</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">ages</b>
[73, 47, 80, 17, 15, 22, 54, 92, 57, 26]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">assert ages[0] &lt;= ages[-1]</b>  # Assert that the first age is &lt;= the last age.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;python-input-0&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AssertionError
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">Unlike exceptions, your code should <i class="calibre5">not</i> handle <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> statements with <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">try</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except</span>; if an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> fails, your program <i class="calibre5">should</i> crash. By “failing fast” like this, you shorten the time between the original cause of the bug and the moment you first notice it, reducing the amount of code you’ll have to check before finding the bug’s cause.</p>
<p class="tx">Assertions are for programmer errors, not user errors. Assertions should fail only while the program is under development; a user should never see an assertion error in a finished program. For errors that your program can encounter as a normal part of its operation (such as a file not being found or the user entering invalid data), raise an exception instead of detecting it with an <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> statement.</p>

<p class="tni">If you’ve ever put a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">print()</span> function in your code to output some variable’s value while your program is running, you’ve used a form of <i class="calibre5">logging</i> to debug your code. Logging is a great way to understand what’s happening in your program and in what order it’s happening. Python’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">logging</span> module makes it easy to create a record of custom messages that you write. These log messages will describe when the program execution has reached the logging function call and will list any variables you’ve specified at that point in time, providing a trail of breadcrumbs that can help you figure out when things started to go wrong. On the other hand, a missing log message indicates a part of the code was skipped and never executed.</p>

<p class="tx">The benefit of logging levels is that you can change the priority of the logging messages you want to see. Passing <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">logging.DEBUG</span> to the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">basicConfig()</span> function’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">level</span> named parameter will show messages from all the logging levels (DEBUG being the lowest level). But after developing your program some more, you may be interested only in errors. In that case, you can set <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">basicConfig()</span>’s <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">level</span> argument to <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">logging.ERROR</span>. This will show only ERROR and CRITICAL messages and will skip the DEBUG, INFO, and WARNING messages.</p>

<p class="tni">After you’ve debugged your program, you probably don’t want all these log messages cluttering the screen. The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">logging.disable()</span> function disables these so that you don’t have to remove the logging calls by hand. Simply pass a logging level to <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">logging.disable()</span> to suppress all log messages at that level or lower. To disable logging entirely, add <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)</span> to your program. For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">import logging</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b class="calibre10">logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=' %(asctime)s - </b>

<p class="tx">Because <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">logging.disable()</span> will disable all messages after it, you’ll probably want to add it near the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">import logging</span> line of code in your program.

<p class="tni">The <i class="calibre5">debugger</i> is a feature of the Mu editor, IDLE, and other editor software that allows you to execute your program one line at a time. The debugger will run a single line of code and then wait for you to tell it to continue. By running your program “under the debugger” like this, you can take as much time as you want to examine the values in the variables at any given point during the program’s lifetime. This is a valuable tool for tracking down bugs.</p>
<p class="tx">To run a program under Mu’s debugger, click the <b class="calibre10">Debug</b> button in the top row of buttons, next to the Run button. The Debug Inspector pane should open in the right side of the window. This pane lists the current value of variables in your program. In Figure 5-1, the debugger has paused the execution of the program just before it would have run the first line of code. You can see this line highlighted in the file editor.</p>
<figure class="img"><img class="img1" id="calibre_link-698" src="images/000093.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Mu interface." />
<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Figure 5-1: Mu running a program under the debugger</span> Description</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx">Debugging mode also adds the following new buttons to the top of the editor: Continue, Step Over, Step In, and Step Out. The usual Stop button is also available.</p>
<p class="tx">Clicking the Continue button will cause the program to execute normally until it terminates or reaches a <i class="calibre5">breakpoint</i>. (I’ll describe breakpoints later in this chapter.) If you’re done debugging and want the program to continue normally, click the <b class="calibre10">Continue</b> button.</p>
<p class="tx">Clicking the Step In button will cause the debugger to execute the next line of code and then pause again. If the next line of code is a function call, the debugger will <i class="calibre5">step into</i> that function, jumping to the function’s first line of code.</p>
<p class="tx">Clicking the Step Over button will execute the next line of code, similar to the Step In button. However, if the next line of code is a function call, <span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-988" aria-label="104"></span>the Step Over button will <i class="calibre5">step over</i>, or rush through, the code in the function. The function’s code will execute at full speed, and the debugger will pause as soon as the function call returns. For example, if the next line of code calls a <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">spam()</span> function but you don’t really care about code inside this function, you can click Step Over to execute the code in the function at normal speed, and then pause when the function returns. For this reason, using the Step Over button is more common than using the Step In button.</p>
<p class="tx">Clicking the Step Out button will cause the debugger to execute lines of code at full speed until it returns from the current function. If you’ve stepped into a function call with the Step In button and now simply want to keep executing instructions until you leave it, click the Step Out button to <i class="calibre5">step out</i> of the current function call.</p>
<p class="tx">If you want to stop debugging entirely and not bother to continue executing the rest of the program, click the Stop button. The Stop button will immediately terminate the program.</p>

first = input()
print('Enter the second number to add:')

Enter the second number to add:
<b class="calibre10">3</b>
Enter the third number to add:
<b class="calibre10">42</b>
The sum is 5342
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The program hasn’t crashed, but the sum is obviously wrong.</p>
<p class="tx">Run the program again, this time under the debugger. Click the <b class="calibre10">Debug</b> button, and the program should pause on line 1, which is the code it’s about to execute.</p>
<p class="tx">Click the <b class="calibre10">Step Over</b> button once to execute the first <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">print()</span> call. You should use Step Over instead of Step In here because you don’t want to step into the code for the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">print()</span> function (although Mu should prevent the debugger from entering Python’s built-in functions). The debugger moves on to line 2, and highlights line 2 in the file editor, as shown in Figure 5-2. This shows you where the program execution currently is.</p>

<p class="tx">Stepping through the program with the debugger is helpful but can also be slow. Often, you’ll want the program to run normally until it reaches a certain line of code. You can configure the debugger to do this with breakpoints.</p>

<p class="tni">Setting a <i class="calibre5">breakpoint</i> on a specific line of code forces the debugger to pause whenever the program execution reaches that line. Open a new file editor tab and enter the following program, which simulates flipping a coin 1,000 times. Save it as <i class="calibre5">coinFlip.py</i>:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">import random
heads = 0
for i in range(1, 1001):
  <span class="code_codeannotation" aria-label="annotation1">❶</span> if random.randint(0, 1) == 1:
        heads = heads + 1
    if i == 500:
      <span class="code_codeannotation" aria-label="annotation2">❷</span> print('Halfway done!')
print('Heads came up ' + str(heads) + ' times.')
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">random.randint(0, 1)</span> call <span class="codeannotation" aria-label="annotation1">❶</span> will return <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">0</span> half of the time and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1</span> the other half of the time, simulating a 50/50 coin flip where <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1</span> represents heads. When you run this program without the debugger, it quickly outputs something like the following:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre9">Halfway done!
Heads came up 490 times.
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">If you ran this program under the debugger, you would have to click the Step Over button thousands of times before the program terminated. If you were interested in the value of <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">heads</span> at the halfway point of the program’s execution, when 500 of 1,000 coin flips have been completed, you could instead just set a breakpoint on the line <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">print('Halfway done!')</span> <span class="codeannotation" aria-label="annotation2">❷</span>. To set a breakpoint, click the line number in the file editor. This should cause a red dot to appear, marking the breakpoint; see Figure 5-4.</p>
<span role="doc-pagebreak" type="pagebreak" id="calibre_link-1523" aria-label="107"></span>

</figure>
<p class="tx">Note that you wouldn’t want to set a breakpoint on the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">if</span> statement line, as the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">if</span> statement executes on every single iteration through the loop. When you set the breakpoint on the code in the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">if</span> statement, the debugger breaks only when the execution enters the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">if</span> clause.</p>
<p class="tx">Now when you run the program under the debugger, it should start in a paused state at the first line, as usual, but if you click Continue, the program should run at full speed until it reaches the line with the breakpoint set on it. You can then click Continue, Step Over, Step In, or Step Out to continue as normal.</p>
<p class="tx">If you want to remove a breakpoint, click the line number again. The red dot will go away, and the debugger won’t break on that line in the future.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-1524"><span id="calibre_link-105"></span><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Summary</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Assertions, exceptions, logging, and the debugger are all valuable tools to find and prevent bugs in your program. Assertions with the Python <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">assert</span> statement are a good way to implement “sanity checks” that give you an early warning when a necessary condition doesn’t hold true. Assertions are only for errors that the program shouldn’t try to recover from, and they should fail fast. Otherwise, you should raise an exception.</p>
<p class="tx">An exception can be caught and handled by the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">try</span> and <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">except</span> statements. The <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">logging</span> module is a good way to look into your code while it’s running, and it is much more convenient to use than the <span class="thesansmonocd_w5regular_">print()</span> function because of its different logging levels and its ability to log to a text file.</p>
<p class="tx">The debugger lets you step through your program one line at a time. Alternatively, you can run your program at normal speed and have the debugger pause execution whenever it reaches a line with a breakpoint set. Using the debugger, you can see the state of any variable’s value at any point during the program’s lifetime.</p>
<p class="tx">Accidentally introducing bugs into your code is a fact of life, no matter how many years of coding experience you have. These debugging tools and techniques will help you write programs that work.</p>
